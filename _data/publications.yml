  title: "Precise End-Effector Control for an Aerial Manipulator Under Composite Disturbances: Theory and Experiments"
  venue: IEEE TTransactions on Automation Science and Engineering (IEEE TASE), 2024
  description: "In this work, a composite control scheme is constructed, which consists of the manipulator joint velocity planner and the dynamic controller. The joint velocity is generated to counteract the fluctuation of the aerial platform. Furthermore, the dynamic controller is developed to accurately track the planned joint velocity in the presence of strong coupling and model  uncertainties."

  title: "Feedback favors the generalization of neural ODEs"
  venue: International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2025
  description: "We present feedback neural networks, showing that a feedback loop can flexibly correct the learned latent dynamics of neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs), leading to a prominent generalization improvement."

  title: "Millimeter-level pick and peg-in-hole task achieved by aerial manipulator"
  venue: Submitted to Science Robotics (JCR Q1 IF:27.5), 2025
  description: "Inspired by the astonishing hunting behavior observed in predatory birds, the first example of Capturing Active Pen-size Target via a Unified and Robust Eagle-like Robot (CAPTURER), is developed in this work. The CAPTURER features a whole biomimetic framework including mechanical design, onboard perception, motion planning, dynamic control, and dexterous manipulation, satisfying ARTS. This represents the fastest and most accurate vision-based grasping performance reported in the literature."

  title: "A Learning-Enhanced Control Scheme for Aerial Manipulator Under Composite Disturbances"
  venue: Submitted to Fundamental Research (JCR Q1 IF:6.3), 2025
  description: "The proposed scheme combines learning-based approximation with observer-based compensation to address unknown high-order nonlinear terms in a complementary principle. Specially, based on the polynomial decomposition theorem, the unknown high-order coupling terms are decomposed into the shared state-related matrix and the parameter-related unknown vector. By resorting to the offline extracted state-related basis, an adaptive law is formulated to update the parameter-dependent vector online. Furthermore, a residual observer is adopted to address the instability problem caused by the online update process under sudden external disturbances"

  title: "Learning-based Observer for Coupled Disturbance"
  venue: The Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2025
  description: "Different from previous disturbance estimation methods that learning coupled disturbance integrally, the decomposition-learning-estimation workflow is achieved for the first time by using Chebyshev polynomial. The primary philosophy is the refined combination of offline learning of the unchanged state-related structure and online adaption to the changing external disturbance-related part. In this way, the interpretability is ensured and the online learning burden can be significantly reduced."

  title: "Precise End-Effector Control for an Aerial Manipulator Under Composite Disturbances: Theory and Experiments"
  venue: IEEE TTransactions on Automation Science and Engineering (IEEE TASE JCR Q1 IF:6.4), 2024
  description: "In this work, a composite control scheme is constructed, which consists of the manipulator joint velocity planner and the dynamic controller. The joint velocity is generated to counteract the fluctuation of the aerial platform. Furthermore, the dynamic controller is developed to accurately track the planned joint velocity in the presence of strong coupling and model  uncertainties."

  title: "Design of an Aerial Manipulator System Applied to Capture Missions"
  venue: International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS), 2021
  description: "This paper proposes the design of an aerial manipulator system for capture missions. A novel mechanical layout is designed. A 5-degree-of freedom manipulator and the battery are placed at the front and back part of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) respectively. This layout can expand the task space and minimize the shift of the center of mass. To improve the success rate of capture, inspired by the predation maneuver of birds, online trajectory generation law for capture mission is proposed. The aerial manipulator points towards its target during the flight."

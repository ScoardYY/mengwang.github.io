  title: "Feedback favors the generalization of neural ODEs"
  venue: International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2025
  description: "We present feedback neural networks, showing that a feedback loop can flexibly correct the learned latent dynamics of neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs), leading to a prominent generalization improvement."

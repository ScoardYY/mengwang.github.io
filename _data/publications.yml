  title: "Millimeter-level pick and peg-in-hole task achieved by aerial manipulator"
  venue: Submitted to Science Robotics (JCR Q1 IF:27.5), 2025
  description: "Inspired by the astonishing hunting behavior observed in predatory birds, the first example of Capturing Active Pen-size Target via a Unified and Robust Eagle-like Robot (CAPTURER), is developed in this work. The CAPTURER features a whole biomimetic framework including mechanical design, onboard perception, motion planning, dynamic control, and dexterous manipulation, satisfying ARTS. This represents the fastest and most accurate vision-based grasping performance reported in the literature."

  title: "Learning-based Observer for Coupled Disturbance"
  venue: The Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2025
  description: "Different from previous disturbance estimation methods that learning coupled disturbance integrally, the decomposition-learning-estimation workflow is achieved for the first time by using Chebyshev polynomial. The primary philosophy is the refined combination of offline learning of the unchanged state-related structure and online adaption to the changing external disturbance-related part."

  title: "Precise End-Effector Control for an Aerial Manipulator Under Composite Disturbances: Theory and Experiments"
  venue: IEEE TTransactions on Automation Science and Engineering (JCR Q1 IF:6.4), 2024
  description: "A composite control scheme is constructed, which consists of the manipulator joint velocity planner and the dynamic controller. The joint velocity is generated to counteract the fluctuation of the aerial platform. The dynamic controller is developed to accurately track the planned joint velocity in the presence of strong coupling and model  uncertainties."
